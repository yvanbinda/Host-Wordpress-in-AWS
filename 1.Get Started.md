# Step 1: Choose Your Region
Selecting a region is crucial as it determines the physical location of your resources. Choose a region that aligns with your target audience or is based on factors like latency and compliance requirements.
# Step 2: Create a VPC
In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the VPC service and create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 
Follow these sub-steps: 

**Create an Internet Gateway and Attach It to Your VPC:**
The Internet Gateway enables communication between your VPC and the Internet, allowing your WordPress site to be publicly accessible.

**Create Two Subnets in Different Availability Zones:**
 Distributing subnets across multiple Availability Zones improves fault tolerance and high availability for your application.
 
**Modify Auto-Assign IP Settings for Each Subnet**
Enabling auto-assign public IPv4 addresses ensures that instances in these subnets receive a public IP, making them accessible from the internet.

**Create a Public Route Table**
A public route table defines how traffic is directed in and out of the subnets. Associating subnets with this table allows instances in those subnets to communicate with the internet.

**Create Four Private Subnets**

**Name Two as "App Tier" and Two as "Database Tier"**
Categorizing subnets simplifies resource management and enhances security by grouping components based on their functions.

**Create Two Route Tables**

**- Connect One Route Table to Subnets in Availability Zone 1**
Route tables determine where network traffic is directed. Associating specific route tables with subnets ensures proper routing based on availability zones.

**- Create Another Route Table for Availability Zone 2**
Separating route tables for different availability zones allows for customized network configurations, optimizing performance and redundancy.

These initial steps lay the foundation for a well-structured VPC that provides both public and private subnets, enhancing the security and scalability of your WordPress hosting environment. In the subsequent steps, we'll continue building upon this foundation to set up the application and database tiers.
