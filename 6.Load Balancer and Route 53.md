# Step 8: Create Load Balancer for WordPress
In this step, we'll create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic to the instances "Server 1" and "Server 2."
## Create Application Load Balancer
### Create Load Balancer:
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard: In the AWS Management Console, go to the EC2 service.

-	Click on "Load Balancers" in the left navigation pane.
  
-	Click the "Create Load Balancer" button.
  
**Configure Load Balancer Settings:**

-	Choose "Application Load Balancer."
  
#### Configure the basic settings:
o	**Name:** Enter a name for your ALB.

o	**Scheme:** Choose "internet-facing" for a public-facing load balancer.

o	**IP address type:** Choose "ipv4."

o	**Listeners:** Select "HTTP" and "HTTPS" (if you have an SSL certificate).

#### Configure Security Groups
Connect the ALB to the ALB Security Group.

Configure Routing:

-	In the "Target group" section, click "Create a target group."
  
**Name:** Enter a name for the target group.

**Protocol:** Choose "HTTP."

**Port:** Enter "80."

**Target type:** Choose "Instance."

#### Register Targets
In the "Register targets" section, select both "Server 1" and "Server 2."

Review your settings and click "Create." Wait for the ALB to be created. Once it's ready, note down the DNS name.
Update the WordPress site URL and home URL to the DNS name of your ALB in the WordPress admin settings.



# Step 9: Register Your Domain Name
In this step, you'll use AWS Route 53 to register your domain name.

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the "Services" dropdown.
Under the "Networking & Content Delivery" section, select "Route 53."

#### Check Domain Availability
In the Route 53 dashboard, choose "Domain Registration" in the left navigation pane.

Enter your preferred domain name in the search bar.
Route 53 will check the availability of the domain. If it's available, proceed to the next steps.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the domain registration process.
Provide necessary information, including contact details and DNS configuration.

#### Configure DNS Settings
During the registration process, configure DNS settings based on your requirements. You can choose to use the default AWS nameservers or configure custom nameservers.
Complete Registration
Review your settings and complete the registration process.
It may take some time for the domain registration to complete. Once the registration is successful, you'll receive confirmation.

#### Note
After domain registration, update the DNS records in Route 53 to point to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) created in Step 8. Configure an alias record (A or CNAME) for your domain, pointing to the DNS name of the ALB.
Update the WordPress site URL and home URL in the WordPress admin settings to reflect your registered domain.
