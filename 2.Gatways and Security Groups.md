# Step 2: Create a NAT Gateway
### Allocate 2 Elastic IP Addresses to Public Subnet 1 and Public Subnet 2
Elastic IP addresses provide a static IP for your NAT Gateway. Allocating one for each public subnet ensures that they remain constant, even if the NAT Gateway restarts.
### Create the NAT Gateway
A Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway allows instances in your private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from directly reaching them. This is crucial for updates, license checks, and other external dependencies.

These steps ensure that your private subnets have secure access to the internet through the NAT Gateway, providing a controlled and secure environment for your WordPress application and database tiers. In the following steps, we'll build upon this foundation to configure the application and database components.

# Step 3: Create Security Groups
## Create a Security Group for the App Load Balancer
-	**Connect to the Previously Created VPC:** In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service, and under "Security Groups," create a new security group for the App Load Balancer.
-	**Configure Inbound Rules:** Define inbound rules to allow traffic necessary for the App Load Balancer. This typically includes allowing HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
This security group ensures that the load balancer can communicate with the instances in the webserver security group.
## Create Another Security Group for the Webserver
-	**Connect to the Previously Created VPC:** In the EC2 service, create a new security group for the webserver.
-	**Configure Inbound Rules to MySQL/Aurora and Accept Traffic Only to the Webserver:** Define inbound rules to allow traffic specifically to the MySQL/Aurora database. This restricts access to the database only from instances in the webserver security group.
This security group enhances security by limiting database access to the webserver instances.
## Create a Security Group for the Elastic File System (EFS)
-	**Connect to the Previously Created VPC:** In the EC2 service, create a new security group for the Elastic File System.
-	**Configure Inbound Rules to NFS and Accept Traffic Only from the Webserver Security Group:** Allow NFS traffic from instances in the Webserver security group to access the EFS.
-	**Add a Rule in the Inbound Rules to Another NFS, but Accept Traffic from the EFS Security Group:** Allow NFS traffic from instances in the EFS security group to access another NFS resource.
This security group setup ensures controlled access to the EFS, limiting traffic to and from specified resources and enhancing overall security.
These security groups play a crucial role in controlling traffic flow between different components of your AWS environment, ensuring that only authorized communication occurs. In the upcoming steps, we'll continue setting up and configuring various components to complete the WordPress hosting environment.
