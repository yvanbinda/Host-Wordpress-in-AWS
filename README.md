# WordPress Hosting on AWS Infrastructure
This project demonstrates the setup and deployment of a scalable and resilient WordPress website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. Leveraging AWS services such as EC2 instances, RDS for MySQL, Elastic File System (EFS), and Application Load Balancer (ALB), the project ensures high availability, security, and efficient resource utilization. The step-by-step tutorial covers VPC creation, subnet configuration, security group setup, instance provisioning, software stack installation (Apache, PHP, MySQL), Elastic File System integration, and load balancing. Additionally, the tutorial guides users through the registration of a custom domain using AWS Route 53. The result is a fully functional WordPress site with optimal performance and reliability on the AWS cloud platform.
