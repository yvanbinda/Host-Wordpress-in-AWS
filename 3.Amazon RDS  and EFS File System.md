# Amazon RDS and EFS File System

# Step 4: Create an Amazon RDS Database
## Create a Database Subnet Group
•	**Connect It to the Two Availability Zones:** In the Amazon RDS service, navigate to "Subnet Groups" and create a new database subnet group. Connect it to both Availability Zones created earlier.
•	**Connect to One Subnet in Each of the Availability Zones:** Select one subnet from each Availability Zone. This ensures that your RDS database is highly available and fault-tolerant.
•	Distributing the database across multiple Availability Zones improves resilience and ensures continuous operation in case of failures.
## Create a Database
•	**Choose the Standard Create Option:** In the RDS dashboard, click "Create Database" and choose the standard create option.
•**	Choose MySQL and Select Your Preferred Version:** Select MySQL as the database engine and choose your preferred version.
•	Continue to Follow the Wizard: Follow the steps in the wizard, providing necessary information such as DB instance identifier, master username, and password.
•	**Connect to Your VPC and the Different Subnets:** Under "Network & Security," connect the RDS instance to your previously created VPC and choose the database subnet group you created.
•	Deny Public Access: For security reasons, deny public access to the RDS instance since it will be accessed internally.
•	**Connect to the Previously Created Database Security Group:** Select the database security group created in Step 3 to control inbound and outbound traffic to the RDS instance.
•	**Select the Availability Zone that will Launch the Database:** Choose the preferred Availability Zone where the RDS database will be launched.

These configurations ensure that your RDS database is securely integrated into your VPC and is accessible only by authorized components within your environment.
In the next steps, we'll continue building upon this foundation by configuring components like the application load balancer, web servers, and the Elastic File System to create a comprehensive AWS environment for hosting a WordPress website.

# Step 5: Create an EFS File System
**Start the Creation Wizard:** In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EFS service and start the creation wizard for a new file system.

**At the Level of Networking, Choose Your VPC:** In the wizard, when prompted for networking settings, choose the VPC you previously created for your WordPress environment.
**Connect to the Two Availability Zones Recently Created: ** Select both Availability Zones that were recently created for your database and application tiers.
Distributing the EFS file system across multiple Availability Zones enhances fault tolerance and ensures high availability.

**At AZ1 (Take AZ as Availability Zone), Select Private Subnet 3 (Database Tier):** Choose the private subnet in Availability Zone 1 (AZ1) that is part of the database tier (e.g., Subnet 3).
**At AZ2 , Select the Private Subnet 4 (Database Tier):** Similarly, choose the private subnet in Availability Zone 2 (AZ2) that is part of the database tier (e.g., Subnet 4).
**Attach Both AZs to the EFS Security Group:** During the wizard, attach both Availability Zones to the EFS security group created earlier in Step 3.
Associating the EFS file system with the database tier subnets and security group ensures that the file system is securely accessible by the database instances.

These configurations establish the Elastic File System (EFS) within your AWS environment, connecting it to the designated subnets and security groups. In the subsequent steps, we'll continue setting up and linking components to complete the architecture.
