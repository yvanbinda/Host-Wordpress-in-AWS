# Step 7: Launch a New Instance and Install WordPress
# Launch a New Instance

•	**Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI:** In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service and launch a new instance. Choose the Amazon Linux 2 AMI as your base image.

•	**Connect to Your Created VPC:** During the instance creation process, connect the new instance to the VPC you created.

•	**Connect It to the Public Network 1 in AZ1:** Assign the instance to the public subnet in Availability Zone 1 (AZ1) within your VPC.
Connect It to the Application LB Security Group, the SSH Security Group, and the Webserver Security Group: Specify the security groups for the instance. Connect it to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) security group, the SSH security group, and the webserver security group.

These security groups control the traffic to and from the instance, ensuring secure communication with the ALB, SSH access, and proper interaction with the web servers.
# Install WordPress
### **1.	SSH into Your Newly Created Instance**
Use SSH to connect to the new instance. Use the Following Commands to Install WordPress:
#### # Switch to superuser sudo su 
#### # Update the system yum update -y 
#### # Create the html directory and mount the EFS to it                                                             
mkdir -p /var/www/html sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport  [Your-EFS-FileSystem-ID].efs.[Your-Region].amazonaws.com:/ /var/www/html 
_Replace [Your-EFS-FileSystem-ID] and [Your-Region] with the appropriate values for your Amazon EFS file system._

This set of commands creates the necessary directory for hosting WordPress and mounts the Elastic File System (EFS) to it. WordPress files will be stored in the EFS for scalability and resilience.

These steps launch a new instance, connect it to the required networks, and set up the directory structure for hosting WordPress on the mounted Elastic File System. In the subsequent steps, we'll continue configuring and finalizing the WordPress installation.

### 2.	Install Apache
# Install Apache and related tools sudo yum install -y httpd httpd-tools mod_ssl 
# Enable Apache to start on boot sudo systemctl enable httpd 
# Start the Apache service sudo systemctl start httpd 
-	Install Apache and Related Tools: This command installs Apache, the HTTP server software, along with related tools and the mod_ssl module for SSL support.
-	Enable Apache to Start on Boot: systemctl enable ensures that Apache starts automatically when the system boots up.
-	Start the Apache Service: systemctl start initiates the Apache service.
Installing and starting Apache is a crucial step for hosting a WordPress website, as Apache will serve as the web server to handle incoming requests.
3.	Install PHP 7.4
# Enable PHP 7.4 repository sudo amazon-linux-extras enable php7.4 
# Clean metadata sudo yum clean metadata 
# Install PHP and common packages sudo yum install php php-common php-pear -y 
# Install additional PHP modules sudo yum install php-{cgi,curl,mbstring,gd,mysqlnd,gettext,json,xml,fpm,intl,zip} -y 
Enable PHP 7.4 Repository: amazon-linux-extras enable enables the PHP 7.4 repository, allowing you to install this specific version.
-	Clean Metadata: yum clean metadata cleans the local repository metadata to ensure that the latest package information is fetched during installation.
-	Install PHP and Common Packages: yum install php php-common php-pear -y installs PHP and common packages.
-	Install Additional PHP Modules: yum install php-{cgi,curl,mbstring,gd,mysqlnd,gettext,json,xml,fpm,intl,zip} -y installs additional PHP modules required for WordPress and its dependencies.
Installing PHP and its modules is essential for WordPress, as it is a PHP-based application. These modules provide the necessary functionality for processing PHP scripts and interacting with other components of the WordPress stack.


4.	Install MySQL 5.7
# Install MySQL 5.7 repository sudo rpm -Uvh https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm 
# Install MySQL Community Server sudo yum install mysql-community-server -y 
# Enable MySQL to start on boot sudo systemctl enable mysqld 
# Start the MySQL service sudo systemctl start mysqld 
-	Install MySQL 5.7 Repository: This command installs the MySQL 5.7 repository, allowing you to install the specific version of MySQL.
-	Install MySQL Community Server: yum install mysql-community-server -y installs the MySQL Community Server.
-	Enable MySQL to Start on Boot: systemctl enable mysqld ensures that MySQL starts automatically when the system boots up.
-	Start the MySQL Service: systemctl start mysqld initiates the MySQL service.
MySQL is a crucial component for WordPress, serving as the database backend. Installing and starting MySQL sets up the database server required for WordPress to store its data.
5.	Set Permissions
# Add ec2-user to the apache group sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user 
# Change ownership and permissions for the /var/www directory 
sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www 
sudo chmod 2775 /var/www && find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \; 
sudo find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \; 

# Change ownership for the /var/www/html directory sudo chown apache:apache -R /var/www/html 
Add ec2-user to the Apache Group: usermod -a -G apache ec2-user adds the ec2-user to the apache group, ensuring that both users have appropriate permissions for serving web content.
Change Ownership and Permissions for the /var/www Directory: The following commands ensure that the /var/www directory and its subdirectories have the correct ownership and permissions for Apache to read and write files.
Change Ownership for the /var/www/html Directory: chown apache:apache -R /var/www/html specifically adjusts ownership for the HTML directory, ensuring Apache has the necessary permissions to serve content.
Setting the correct permissions is essential for Apache to access and serve the WordPress files. These commands ensure that both the ec2-user and apache have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the designated directories.
6.	Download WordPress Files
# Download the latest WordPress release wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz 
# Extract the WordPress files tar -xzf latest.tar.gz 
# Copy WordPress files to the /var/www/html directory cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/ 
Download the Latest WordPress Release: wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz fetches the latest WordPress release from the official website.
Extract the WordPress Files: tar -xzf latest.tar.gz extracts the contents of the downloaded tarball.
Copy WordPress Files to the /var/www/html Directory: cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/ copies the extracted WordPress files to the Apache's web root directory.
7.	Create the wp-config.php File
# Copy the wp-config-sample.php file to create wp-config.php cp /var/www/html/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wp-config.php 
Copy the wp-config-sample.php File: cp /var/www/html/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wp-config.php duplicates the sample configuration file to create the actual wp-config.php file.
Creating the wp-config.php file is a necessary step in configuring WordPress. The configuration file holds essential settings, including database connection details and security keys.
Remember to replace the placeholder values with the actual information from your RDS database.
# Open the wp-config.php file for editing using nano or your preferred text editor          nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php 
In the wp-config.php file, you'll need to locate and update the following sections with the information from your RDS database:
#The name of the database for WordPress
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
#MySQL database username
define('DB_USER', 'your_database_username');
#MySQL database password
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_database_password');
#MySQL hostname
define('DB_HOST', 'your_rds_endpoint'); // This should be the endpoint of your RDS instance

Replace 'your_database_name', 'your_database_username', 'your_database_password', and 'your_rds_endpoint' with the actual values from your RDS configuration.
After updating the wp-config.php file, save the changes. This step ensures that WordPress is configured to connect to your MySQL database hosted on RDS.
This command restarts the Apache HTTP server, ensuring that the changes made to the configuration files and WordPress setup take effect.
8.	sudo systemctl restart httpd

Step 7: Create and Configure Instances for WordPress Hosting
In this step, we'll create two instances, "Server 1" and "Server 2," and configure them for hosting WordPress. These instances will be part of the App Tier and connect to the Webserver Security Group.
Create "Server 1"
Launch a New Instance: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to EC2, and launch a new instance.
Connect Your VPC: During the instance creation process, connect the new instance to your created VPC.
Connect to Private Subnet 1 (App Tier): Assign the instance to the private subnet in Availability Zone 1 (AZ1) within your VPC.
Paste the User Data Script: In the "User Data" section, paste the following script:
yum update -y 
sudo yum install -y httpd httpd-tools mod_ssl 
sudo systemctl enable httpd 
sudo systemctl start httpd 
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable php7.4 
sudo yum clean metadata 
sudo yum install php php-common php-pear -y 
sudo yum install php-{cgi,curl,mbstring,gd,mysqlnd,gettext,json,xml,fpm,intl,zip} -y 
sudo rpm -Uvh https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm sudo yum install mysql-community-server -y sudo systemctl enable mysqld 
sudo systemctl start mysqld echo "fs-aed8ad5b.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /var/www/html nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 0 0" >> /etc/fstab mount -a 
sudo systemctl restart httpd 
Name It "Server 1a": Give the instance a name, such as "Server 1a."
Connect to the Webserver Security Group: In the security group configuration, connect the instance to the Webserver Security Group.
Create "Server 2"
Launch Another Instance: Repeat the steps to launch a new instance.
Connect Your VPC: During the instance creation process, connect the new instance to your created VPC.
Connect to Private Subnet 2 (App Tier): Assign the instance to the private subnet in Availability Zone 2 (AZ2) within your VPC.
Paste the Same User Data Script: Paste the same user data script from above in the "User Data" section.
Name It "Server 1b": Give the instance a name, such as "Server 1b."
Connect to the Webserver Security Group: In the security group configuration, connect the instance to the Webserver Security Group.
