# Step 6: Install WordPress and Move Files to EFS
# Create a Security Group for SSH
**-	Connect to Your VPC:** In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service, and under "Security Groups," create a new security group specifically for SSH.

**-	Configure Inbound Rule as SSH and Accept Traffic to Your IP:** Add an inbound rule allowing SSH traffic and accept traffic only from your IP address. This rule ensures secure access to instances using SSH.
### Update EFS Security Group Inbound Rule
**-	Go Back to EFS Security Group:** In the EC2 service, navigate to "Security Groups" and locate the security group associated with your Elastic File System (EFS).

**-	Configure Inbound Rule by Adding SSH and Traffic to the SSH Security Group:** Edit the inbound rule of the EFS security group to allow SSH traffic and accept traffic only from the SSH security group created in the previous step.

This configuration ensures that instances associated with the SSH security group can access the EFS file system securely.

## Update Webserver Security Group
**-	Edit Webserver Security Group:** In the EC2 service, locate the security group associated with your web servers.

**-	Add a Rule Named SSH and Configure Its Traffic to the SSH Security Group:** Edit the inbound rules of the webserver security group to include a rule named SSH, allowing traffic only from the SSH security group.This rule ensures that SSH access to the web servers is restricted to instances associated with the SSH security group, enhancing security.

These configurations set up the necessary security groups and rules for secure SSH access to instances and ensure that the web servers and EFS file system are appropriately linked. In the following steps, we'll continue the installation and configuration of WordPress within this secure AWS environment.
